This is an R port of the examples found in [examples/java](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy/tree/main/examples/java) of Google's [Differential Privacy](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy) repository.  **Note this is a work in progress, and only 1 of 4 available examples have been added so far**.

There are four examples all up, each in their own R scripts as follows:

* `R/count_visits_per_hour.R`
* `R/count_visits_per_day.R` (to do)
* `R/sum_revenue_per_hour.R` (to do)
* `R/sum_revenue_per_day.R` (to do)

Note that the fat jar [java/differentialprivacy.jar](java/differentialprivacy.R) was created using sbt and the assembly plugin.
